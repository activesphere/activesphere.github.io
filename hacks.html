          An In-memory dynamodb emulator for
          <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>.
          We build it to help us develop applications on  dynamodb in development and test environments without incurring the costs and the latencies. This also allows us to host the non production versions of the application outside of EC2. It is a Ruby Application.

          Gotunnel allows you to share server running on localhost,
          over the net. localtunnel allows you to do the same, but at
          the time of this writing, didnâ€™t support WebSocket. And
          well, we wanted to do a project in Golang.

          Mini-Mocha is a small experiment at understanding DSL
          of <a href="http://mochajs.org/">mochajs.org</a>. About 100
          lines of code is enough, to implement the synchronous DSL that
          mocha supports. Supporting asynchronous DSL isn't much
          tougher. If you do hack it, please look at
          our <a href="/careers.html">careers</a> page.

          Devmirror is an experiment at remote debugging. May be, an
          experiment gone wild. The idea, is to render a remote users
          browser screen, to a developer. With devtools open at
          developers end, which is connected to the users browser session.
        </p>

        <p class="description">
          In other words, developer see users interaction. And can
          change the page live, for the user. Its like local
          development, but actual browser session is probably happening
          on the other side of the world.
