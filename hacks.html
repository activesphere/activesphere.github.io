hacks:
 - title: httpolice-devtool
   link: https://github.com/activesphere/httpolice-devtool
   description: >
      <p>
        A lint-tool for the HTTP, integrated with Chrome devtools.
      </p>
      <p>
        It intercepts and sends the HTTP headers from your
        browser to a server running <a href="https://github.com/vfaronov/httpolice">httpolice</a>, where they are analysed, and
        a detailed report is sent back to the browser
        where it's displayed.
      </p>

 - title: FakeDynamo
   link: https://github.com/ananthakumaran/fake_dynamo
   description: >
      An In-memory dynamodb emulator for
      <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>.
      We built it to help us develop applications on dynamodb in
      development and test environments without incurring the costs
      and the latencies. This also allows us to host the non
      production versions of the application outside of EC2. It is a
      Ruby Application.
 - title: gotunnel
   link: https://github.com/ciju/gotunnel
   description: >
      <p>
          Gotunnel allows you to share server running on localhost,
          over the net. localtunnel allows you to do the same, but at
          the time of this writing, didn’t support WebSocket. And
          well, we wanted to do a project in Golang.
      </p>

 - title: µ
   link: https://github.com/ananthakumaran/u
   description: >
      μ is a JavaScript library for encoding/decoding state (JavaScript object) in URL. Define a spec for the state, based on which the encoding is done. Manage the state with versioning.

 - title: pdf slide splitter
   link: https://github.com/ciju/split-pdf-slides
   description: >
      A web app to split pdf's with multiple slides per page, to single slide per page. An exploration in webpack, pdf, Google App Engine and more.

 - title: Mini-Mocha
   link: https://github.com/ciju/mini-mocha
   description: >
      <p>
          Mini-Mocha is a small experiment at understanding DSL
          of <a href="http://mochajs.org/">mochajs.org</a>. About 100
          lines of code is enough, to implement the synchronous DSL that
          mocha supports. Supporting asynchronous DSL isn't much
          tougher. If you do hack it, please look at
          our <a href="/careers.html">careers</a> page.

 - title: Devmirror
   link: https://github.com/ciju/devmirror
   description: >
      <p>
          Devmirror is an experiment at remote debugging. May be, an
          experiment gone wild. The idea is to render a remote user's
          browser screen, to a developer. With devtools open at
          developers end, which is connected to the users browser session.
      </p>

      <p>
          In other words, developer see user's interaction. And can
          change the page live, for the user. It's like local
          development, but actual browser session is probably happening
          on the other side of the world.
      </p>

          a <a href="https://hasgeek.tv/bangalorejs/6/563-devsync-demo-by-ciju-cherian">talk</a>
          about it.

 - title: devsync
   link: https://github.com/ciju/devsync
   description: >
      A chrome devtools (WebInspector) hack, which allows your
      css/javascript edits from WebInspector to be saved directly to
      the localhost files. It was a winner at
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121029070152/http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/08/open-hack-india-they-hacked-we-won-them-over/"> Yahoo! Hacknight</a>.
      It is a node.js application
