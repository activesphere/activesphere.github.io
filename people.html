  blurb: >
    He joined us as a campus recruit from IIIT Bangalore. Since then
    has worked on Android and iOS. Now works on Rails apps. His latest
    craving has become the gym, which he tries to frequent all 5 days
    of the week. Makes a point to catch the latest Tamil movies and is
    working on a movie database app as a hobby. Doesn't mind spending
    some time to teach a noob or two. Is seen with his headset on,
    grooving to his favourite jam at times.

    He's always up and ready to help any of us, be it a squeaky chair or a WiFi problem. Sreenu will fix it up
    in a jiffy. While we're hacking away, he reminders us to fuel up and orders some grub. He's an avid YouTube watcher and is sometimes seen giggling away at some comedy scene he just watched. He makes sure to catch the latest Telugu flick and is a hardcore Cricket fan!

  blurb: >
    He joined us fresh out of college, hoping to learn a lot more here, than from the typical MNC. Has worked on Node JS, Backbone, and Rails. Has broken client API's a few times and fixed them of course! Spends time watching TV shows and catching the latest movie. Like Bruce Banner says, "He's always angry", this guy says "He's always hungry". Enjoys camping at home, weekend getaways and Biryani!
