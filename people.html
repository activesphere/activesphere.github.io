          He joined us as a campus recruit from IIIT Bangalore. Since then has worked on Android and iOS. Now works on Rails apps. His latest craving has become the gym, which he tries to frequent all 5 days of the week. Makes a point to catch the latest Tamil movies and is working on a movie database app as a hobby. Doesn't mind spending
          some time to teach a noob or two. Is seen with his headset on, grooving to his favourite jam at times.

          He joined us fresh out of college, hoping to learn a lot more here, than from the typical MNC. Has worked on Node JS, Backbone, and Rails. Has broken client API's a few times and fixed them of course! Spends time watching TV shows and catching the latest movie. Like Bruce Banner says, "He's always angry", this guy says "He's always hungry". Enjoys camping at home, weekend getaways and Biryani!
