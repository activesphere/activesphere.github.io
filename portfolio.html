      <p>
        Put yourself in the shoes of a energy manager, who is looking
        over energy consumption of a university. Where is the energy
        consumed? Whats the change in consumption, in comparison to
        last month, or last year? Where are the emissions happening?
        This tool was built to help monitoring energy consumption
        across multiple properties & locations (eg: universities,
        chain of restaurants etc.)
      </p>

      <p>
        We helped PulseEnergy (now acquired by EnerNOC), to build this
        tool. We worked remotely with the a team of Engineers at
        PulseEnergy, for over 2 years. Most of the product was written
        by us.
