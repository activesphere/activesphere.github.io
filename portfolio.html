   link: https://www.enernoc.com/
   customer: EnerNOC
   stack: AngularJS, d3.js, webpack, node.js

      <p>
        Put yourself in the shoes of a energy manager, who is looking
        over energy consumption of a university. Where is the energy
        consumed? Whats the change in consumption, in comparison to
        last month, or last year? Where are the emissions happening?
        This tool was built to help monitoring energy consumption
        across multiple properties & locations (eg: universities,
        chain of restaurants etc.)
      </p>

      <p>
        We helped PulseEnergy (now acquired by EnerNOC), to build this
        tool. We worked remotely with the a team of Engineers at
        PulseEnergy, for over 2 years. Most of the product was written
        by us.

        The video below, show some features of the app, allowing
        slicing & dicing of multiple types of data, across multiple
        dimensions.

 - title: Optimize an e-commerce product listing page
   link: http://www.abof.com/men/clothing/jeans
   customer: all about fashion
   stack: React, webpack
   description: >
      <p>

        We work with our clients to understand their business and
        concerns. ABOF, wanted a head start in their front-end dev
        stack. We worked on a few important pages of the incoming
        traffic, and replicated the same functionality that the
        existing IBM WebSphere based front-end offered, over the span
        of 3 months.

        And when we shipped it, it was among the fast loading sites.

        Our aim, was to give ABOF a head start with the technology, so
        their internal team could pick up and continue the work. We
        worked with their engineers, tech team and product team, to
        figure out what was needed, which parts could be compromised
        for shipping the product faster, and how to achieve the
        desired speeds with existing infrastructure.

        With the success of the first implementation (The business saw
        a considerable increase in the conversion rate), ABOF asked us
        again, to redo their checkout process. Which, again, we
        delivered in 2 months, within time.

        Below is the loading times of the listing page of various
        e-commerce sites, when we delivered ABOF's listing page.
