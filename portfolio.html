        Midtrans sends out a few hundred thousand messages per day using a
        notification system. We re-wrote this system in Elixir to improve
        performance and decrease resource consumption. The average latency of a
        particular set of notifications decreased from <b>2.9s</b> to
        <b>198ms</b>. The memory consumption went down from
        <b>5.3GB</b> to <b>300MB</b> per node, which brought down the
        hardware cost to 1/3.
     </p>
     <p>
        This is an example of how choosing a technology that fits the problem
        domain well, could improve a system considerably. More details can be found in
        the <a href="https://engineering.midtrans.com/optimizing-the-notification-system/"
        target="_blank">blog post</a> by Midtrans.

        This tool was built to help monitoring energy consumption
        across multiple properties & locations (eg: universities,
        chain of restaurants etc.)
      </p>

      <p>
        We worked remotely with the a team of Engineers at
        PulseEnergy, for over 2 years. Most of the product was written
        by us.
      </p>

      <p>
        The video below, show some features of the app, allowing
        slicing & dicing of multiple types of data, across multiple
        dimensions.

        ABOF, wanted a head start in their front-end dev
        stack. We worked on a few important pages of the incoming
        traffic, and replicated the same functionality that the
        existing IBM WebSphere based front-end offered, over the span
        of 3 months.

      </p>

      <p>

        And when we shipped it, it was among the fastest loading sites.

      </p>

      <p>
        Our aim, was to give ABOF a head start with the technology, so
        their internal team could pick up and continue the work. We
        worked with their engineers, tech team and product team, to
        figure out what was needed, which parts could be compromised
        for shipping the product faster, and how to achieve the
        desired speeds with existing infrastructure.

      </p>

      <p>
        With the success of the first implementation (The business saw
        a considerable increase in the conversion rate), ABOF asked us
        again, to redo their checkout process. Which, again, we
        delivered in 2 months, within time.

      </p>

      <p>
        Below is the loading times of the listing page of various
        e-commerce sites, when we delivered ABOF's listing page.

     Sleekr hired us to help improve the performance and stability of their app.
     Apart from code contributions, we helped provide high level
     technical guidance, laid a 6 month roadmap (to further stability) for
     their tech team to follow & gave regular feedback with code reviews. Some
     specific tasks we were involved with included introducing webpack to an
     alpha version of Angular2 for performance (when it wasn't officially
     supported), de-tangling an over-architected micro-services setup,
     experimenting with GraphQL for some components & building a mapper which
     extracted GraphQL types from Doctrine (an ORM).
