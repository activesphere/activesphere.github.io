        <h2>How we spend our time.</h2>
        <p class='legible_text'>
        We are a group with varied interests. Much of our time is spent
        thinking and writing code for our clients. Some of our time is
        spent in individual curiosities, like programming, mathematics,
        machine learning, business ideas etc.

        Among us, you will find people who're interested in programming,
        math, machine learning, business, learning, fitness, cycling and
        some more. One of us has written an <a
          href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/erbot">irc client</a> in
        Erlang(and later in Elixir), an <a
          href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/neato">NES emulator</a>
        in Golang, and a <a
          href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/webify">font
          converter</a> in Haskell, a <a
          href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide">TypeScript
          development helper</a> package for Emacs, and more. Some one
        else was crazy about cycling (did Nandi trip every now and them,
        till he broke his hand). Finds time to hack something in Node.js
        to connect to his cars OEM, and think up business around it. One
        of us managed a dialing application for client, which at one
        time was the biggest consumer of Twilio (literally brought
        Twilio down in the heat of US election). Another one of us wrote
        a <a href="https://github.com/ciju/gotunnel">tunneling
          solution</a> in Golang (something like localtunnel or
        ngrok). Over it he built a <a
          href="https://github.com/ciju/devmirror">remote chrome
          devtools</a> debugging <a
          href='https://hasgeek.tv/bangalorejs/6/563-devsync-demo-by-ciju-cherian'>
          experience</a>, as a hack. He also probably did the first public
        demo of
        <a href='https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/open-hack-india-4-biggest-one-yet-50211.html#yui_3_9_1_4_1426943237413_181'>
          editing and saving from inside chrome developer tools.
        </a>
        In other words, <b>we create stuff, not because we have to, but
          because we like to.</b>

        <h2>Who we work with.</h2>
        <p class='legible_text'>
        Our clients are usually startups. Some of them want to scale
        their solutions. Others want to build a product from
        scratch. Sometimes, it involves understanding a new domain, and
        building a solution from the ground up. Sometimes they have a
        team, and we work with them. Some other times, its about helping
        with an existing code base. We might be involved in anything from
        brainstorming ideas, to making technical decisions and
        implementing them.

        To give an idea of the more interesting work. One is about
        capturing the energy consumption time series, and charting it in
        different ways (graphing (D3) with heavy interaction). For
        another client we built the architecture to record videos and
        run them though a pipeline of algorithms. In other words, they
        spent their time and energy on vision algorithms (their
        expertise) and we helped them with putting that expertise out as
        a product. It has often been the case that our clients are
        experts in some business domain, and we have to understand that
        domain and build solutions for them.

        We avoid bureaucracy. Our salaries and financial statements are
        open to all employees. We try to be a place where curiosity is
        encouraged. Where colleagues inspire each other with interesting
        thoughts and work. We care deeply about the growth of people
        working with us, as it's our firm belief that this directly
        leads to the growth of the organization.
