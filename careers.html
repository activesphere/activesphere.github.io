        <h3>How we spend our time.</h3>
        <p class='legible_text'>
          We are a group with varied interests. Much of our time is spent
          thinking and writing code for our clients. Some of our time is
          spent in individual curiosities, like programming, mathematics,
          machine learning, business ideas, etc.
        </p>
        <p class='j_verbose j_verbose_we legible_text'>
          We want this company to be centered around individuals. We
          would like each one of us to be known for their work. And
          company as a place which brings us all together.
        </p>


        <p class='j_verbose j_verbose_we legible_text'>
          Among us, you will find people who are interested in
          programming, math, machine learning, business, learning,
          fitness, cycling and some more. Please note that interest
          doesn't mean expertise, or even knowledge. But it shows that
          we explore. One of us has written an
          <a href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/erbot">IRC
          client</a> in Erlang (and later in Elixir),
          an <a href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/neato">NES
          emulator</a> in Golang, and
          a <a href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/webify">font
          converter</a> in Haskell,
          a <a href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide">TypeScript
          development helper</a> package for Emacs (which is linked
          from the official TypeScript website), and more. Another one
          of us wrote
          a <a href="https://github.com/ciju/gotunnel">tunneling
          solution</a> in Golang (something like localtunnel or
          ngrok). And built
          a <a href="https://github.com/ciju/devmirror">remote chrome
          devtools</a>
          debugging <a href="https://hasgeek.tv/bangalorejs/6/563-devsync-demo-by-ciju-cherian">
          experience</a>, as a hack over it.

        <h3>Who we work with.</h3>
        <p class='legible_text'>
          Our clients are usually startups. Some of them want to scale
          their solutions. Others want to build a product from
          scratch. Sometimes, it involves understanding a new domain, and
          building a solution from the ground up. Sometimes they have a
          team, and we work with them. Some other times, it's about helping
          with an existing codebase. We might be involved in anything from
          brainstorming ideas, to making technical decisions and
          implementing them.
        </p>
        <p class='legible_text j_verbose j_verbose_clients'>
          To give an idea of the more interesting work -- One is about
          capturing the energy consumption time series, and charting it in
          different ways (graphing (D3) with heavy interaction). For
          another client we built the architecture to record videos and
          run them though a pipeline of algorithms. In other words, they
          spent their time and energy on vision algorithms (their
          expertise) and we helped them with putting that expertise
          out as a product. It has often been the case that our
          clients are in some business domain, and we have to
          understand that domain and build solutions for them.

        <p class="legible_text">
            Design a Least Frequently Used Cache where in the every get(x) will increment the
            access count for x. The element with the least value of count will be
            evicted/invalidated. Invalidation is done when the cache reaches
            it's limit value.<br/>
            Requirements for get and set of the Cache:<br/>
            put(x, val) -&gt; O(1)<br/>
            get(x) -&gt; O(1)<br/>
            Set the limit of the LFU Cache to 10.<br/>
