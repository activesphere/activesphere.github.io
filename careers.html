    <h3 class="f3">How we spend our time.</h3>
    <p>
      We are a group with varied interests. Much of our time is spent
      thinking and writing code for our clients. Some of our time is
      spent in individual curiosities, like programming, mathematics,
      machine learning, finance etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want this company to be centered around individuals. We would
      like each one of us to grow in their skills and interests, and
      gain perspectives. And company as a place which brings us all
      together.
    </p>

    <p>
      Among us, you will find people who are interested in
      programming, math, machine learning, business, learning,
      fitness, cycling and some more. Please note that interest
      doesn't mean expertise, or even knowledge. But it shows that
      we explore. One of us has written an
      <a class="link dim as-blue" href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/erbot">IRC
        client</a> in Erlang (and later in Elixir),
      an <a class="link dim as-blue" href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/neato">NES
        emulator</a> in Golang, and
      a <a class="link dim as-blue" href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/webify">font
        converter</a> in Haskell,
      a <a class="link dim as-blue" href="https://github.com/ananthakumaran/tide">TypeScript
        development helper</a> package for Emacs (which is linked
      from the official TypeScript website), and more. Another one
      of us wrote
      a <a class="link dim as-blue" href="https://github.com/ciju/gotunnel">tunneling
        solution</a> in Golang (something like localtunnel or
      ngrok). And built
      a <a class="link dim as-blue" href="https://github.com/ciju/devmirror">remote chrome
        devtools</a>
      debugging <a class="link dim as-blue" href="https://hasgeek.tv/bangalorejs/6/563-devsync-demo-by-ciju-cherian">
        experience</a>, as a hack over it.

      In other words,
      <b>we create stuff, not because we have to, but because we
        like to.</b>

    <h3 class="f3">Who we work with.</h3>
    <p>
      Our clients are usually startups. Some of them want to scale
      their solutions. Others want to build a product from
      scratch. Sometimes, it involves understanding a new domain, and
      building a solution from the ground up. Sometimes they have a
      team, and we work with them. Some other times, it's about helping
      with an existing codebase. We might be involved in anything from
      brainstorming ideas, to making technical decisions and
      implementing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To give an idea of the more interesting work -- One is about
      capturing the energy consumption time series, and charting it in
      different ways (graphing (D3) with heavy interaction). For
      another client we built the architecture to record videos and
      run them though a pipeline of algorithms. In other words, they
      spent their time and energy on vision algorithms (their
      expertise) and we helped them with putting that expertise
      out as a product. It has often been the case that our
      clients are in some business domain, and we have to
      understand that domain and build solutions for them.

        <p class='legible_text'>
          We avoid bureaucracy. We try to be a place where curiosity
          is encouraged. Where colleagues make each other think beyong
          day to day life. We would like to define ourselves as an
          organization with interesting individuals.  It's important
          for us to have colleagues who push us to explore our limits.
