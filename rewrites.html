      The success of a rewrite comes down to understanding the problem domain
      and business priorities along with complexity and risk involved in
      the execution. Like most things in life, its a play of tradeoffs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our experience helps us make informed tradeoffs.
    </p>

    <h3 class="f3">Our approach to rewrites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand, accommodate and communicate risks & uncertainties, early in the project.</li>
      <li>Break down the rewrite into smaller chunks, prioritizing components which help improve the system most while keeping risk at a minimum.</li>
      <li>Choose the right technologies and tools. In the past we've picked up Elixir, React, Go, Kubernetes, Kafka, Webpack and more to solve specific problems.</li>
    </ul>
