        Midtrans sends out a few hundred thousand messages per day using a
        notification system. We re-wrote this system in Elixir to improve
        performance and decrease resource consumption. The average latency of a
        particular set of notifications decreased from <b>2.9s</b> to
        <b>198ms</b>. The memory consumption went down from
        <b>5.3GB</b> to <b>300MB</b> per node, which brought down the
        hardware cost to 1/3.
     </p>
     <p>
        This is an example of how choosing a technology that fits the problem
        domain well, could improve a system considerably. More details can be found in
        the <a href="https://engineering.midtrans.com/optimizing-the-notification-system/"

        ABOF, wanted a head start in their front-end dev
        stack. We worked on a few important pages of the incoming
        traffic, and replicated the same functionality that the
        existing IBM WebSphere based front-end offered, over the span
        of 3 months.

      </p>

      <p>

        And when we shipped it, it was among the fastest loading sites.

      </p>

      <p>
        Our aim, was to give ABOF a head start with the technology, so
        their internal team could pick up and continue the work. We
        worked with their engineers, tech team and product team, to
        figure out what was needed, which parts could be compromised
        for shipping the product faster, and how to achieve the
        desired speeds with existing infrastructure.

      </p>

      <p>
        With the success of the first implementation (The business saw
        a considerable increase in the conversion rate), ABOF asked us
        again, to redo their checkout process. Which, again, we
        delivered in 2 months, within time.

      </p>

      <p>
        Below is the loading times of the listing page of various
        e-commerce sites, when we delivered ABOF's listing page.

     Sleekr hired us to help improve the performance and stability of their app.
     We helped detangle an over-architected micro-services setup, provided
     technical guidance & laid a 6 month roadmap to further stability, for
     their tech team to follow.

      Making rewrites successful

      Is your business growth hindered by software â€“ shadowed by performance, scale issues, unmanageable codebase? Your software might need a rewrite.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rewrites have to consider the value it brings to business and <a href="https://codeahoy.com/2016/04/21/when-to-rewrite-from-scratch-autopsy-of-a-failed-software/">the risks involved</a>. We have experience in delivering rewrites in time, while minimising risks.
    </p>

    <h3 class="f3">Our approach to rewrites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Define goals, expectations and priorities of the project.</li>
      <li>Understand, accommodate and communicate risks & uncertainties, early in the project.</li>
      <li>Break down the rewrite into smaller chunks, prioritizing components which help improve the system most while keeping risk at a minimum.</li>
      <li>Choose the right technologies and tools. In the past we've picked up Elixir, React, Go, Kubernetes, Kafka, Webpack and more to solve specific problems.</li>
    </ul>
