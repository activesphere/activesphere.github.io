        Midtrans sends out a few hundred thousand messages per day using a
        notification system. We re-wrote this system in Elixir to improve
        performance and decrease resource consumption. The average latency of a
        particular set of notifications decreased from <b>2.9s</b> to
        <b>198ms</b>. The memory consumption went down from
        <b>5.3GB</b> to <b>300MB</b> per node, which brought down the
        hardware cost to 1/3.
     </p>
     <p>
        This is an example of how choosing a technology that fits the problem
        domain well, could improve a system considerably. More details can be found in
        the <a href="https://engineering.midtrans.com/optimizing-the-notification-system/"

        ABOF, wanted a head start in their front-end dev
        stack. We worked on a few important pages of the incoming
        traffic, and replicated the same functionality that the
        existing IBM WebSphere based front-end offered, over the span
        of 3 months.

      </p>

      <p>

        And when we shipped it, load times were significantly improved from the
        previous version of the website. Which in turn resulted in better conversion.

      </p>

      <p>
        Our aim, was to give ABOF a head start with the technology, for their
        internal team to pick up and continue the work. We worked with their
        engineers, tech team and product team, to figure out what was needed,
        which parts could be compromised for shipping the product faster, and
        how to achieve the desired speeds with existing infrastructure.

      </p>

      <p>
        With the success of the first implementation (The business saw
        a considerable increase in the conversion rate), ABOF asked us
        again, to redo their checkout process. Which, again, we
        delivered in 2 months, within time.

     Sleekr hired us to help improve the performance and stability of their app.
     We helped detangle an over-architected micro-services setup, provided
     technical guidance & laid a 6 month roadmap to further stability, for
     their tech team to follow.

      <!-- Is your business growth hindered by your software â€“ involving performance,
           scale issues or an unmanageable codebase? Your software might need a rewrite. -->
    </p>

    <p>
      The success of a rewrite comes down to understanding the problem domain
      and business priorities along with complexity and risk involved in
      the execution. Like most things in life, its a play of tradeoffs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our experience helps us make good tradeoffs.
    </p>

    <h3 class="f3">Our approach to rewrites</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand, accommodate and communicate risks & uncertainties, early in the project.</li>
      <li>Break down the rewrite into smaller chunks, prioritizing components which help improve the system most while keeping risk at a minimum.</li>
      <li>Choose the right technologies and tools. In the past we've picked up Elixir, React, Go, Kubernetes, Kafka, Webpack and more to solve specific problems.</li>
    </ul>
