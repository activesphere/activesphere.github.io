title: Node.js Module Ecosystem

Node.js is build on some amazing tools. One of it is the use of
Couchdb for NPM, the node.js' package manager. The beauty of using
CouchDb for storing all the packages is that it is open to all for
replication and gives users the ability to host their own private
repositories which synchs with the central repo.

Last weekend I replicated it(all 30Gigs of it) to my couchdb instance
to play around with data stored in it. The first implementation was to
use d3 to create a dependency graph.

There are at the time i took the snapshot, about 20,000 unique modules
and about 53,000 dependency links.
