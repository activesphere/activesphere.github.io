title: Asynchronous Iteration
published: true
---
<p>In Node.js simple things become complicated, because of its asynchronous nature. Most people realized this as soon as they start iterating over stuff. In Node most things are asynchronous, and most IO operations take a callback that is executed as soon as the data is available. And the actual execution returns immediately. This example hopefully makes it clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This sort of behaviour surprises a lot of people, who come from synchronous programming background. If you trpe console.log(data) a few seconds later, it will actually show the correct values on the node commandline. Leading to strange results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple ways of dealing with this situation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Using libraries build on top of node-fibres like <a href="https://github.com/0ctave/node-sync">Node-Sync</a></li>
<li>Use Counters/ nextTick to schedule s</li>
<li>Rolling your own abstraction</li>
<li>Use streamline.js that generates javascript to deal with this issue.</li>
</ol>
