It took us a long time to post this first blog, but we are
officially here now.


We started as a small consultancy offering our Rails expertise in
April, last year. We are passionate about technology and have huge
interest and deep insight into Bigdata, NoSql technologies, and of
course Rails.

Work has been very interesting and hectic. Now we are making time to
post our thoughts, ideas and rants here.

To learn more about us, Check out our

I hope you enjoy this journey with us. Please follow us on twitter

Cheers
