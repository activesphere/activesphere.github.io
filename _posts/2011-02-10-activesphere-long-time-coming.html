<p>It took us a long time to post this first blog, but we are officially here now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We started as a small consultancy offering our Rails expertise in April, last year. We are passionate about technology and have huge interest and deep insight into Bigdata, NoSql technologies, and of course Rails.</p>
<p>Work has been very interesting and hectic. Now we are making time to post our thoughts, ideas and rants here.</p>
<p>To learn more about us, Check out our <a href="http://www.activesphere.com/about.html" title="About">About</a> Page</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy this journey with us. Please follow us on twitter&nbsp; <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/activesphere">@activesphere</a></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
