I spoke at the JsFoo a month ago, It was a brief introduction to Node and things we dealt with when building Activenode(from the NodeKnockout).


It was meant for a beginer Node programmer who knows javascript but is still trying to wrap his head around the asyncronicity of Node.

I hope to update the presentation with all the stuff we've been learning, soon enough.

Here it is on [iWork](http://public.iwork.com/document/?a=p1351648204&amp;d=How_to_not_suck_at_Node.js.key)
