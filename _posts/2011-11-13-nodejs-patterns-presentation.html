<p>I spoke at the JsFoo a month ago, It was a brief introduction to Node and things we dealt with when building Activenode( from the NodeKnockout).</p>
<p>It was meant for a beginer Node programmer who knows javascript but is still trying to wrap his head around the asyncronicity of Node.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope to update the presentation with all the stuff we've been learning, soon enough.</p>
<p>Here it is on <a href="http://public.iwork.com/document/?a=p1351648204&amp;d=How_to_not_suck_at_Node.js.key">iWork</a></p>
