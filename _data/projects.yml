    <p>Midtrans sends out a few hundred thousand messages per day using a notification system. We re-wrote this system in Elixir to improve performance and decrease resource consumption. The average latency of a particular set of notifications decreased from <strong>2.9s</strong> to <strong>198ms</strong>. The memory consumption went down from <strong>5.3<abbr>GB</abbr></strong> to <strong>300<abbr>MB</abbr></strong> per node, which brought down the hardware cost to 1/3.</p>

    <p>This is an example of how choosing a technology that fits the problem domain well, could improve a system considerably. More details can be found in the <a href="https://engineering.midtrans.com/optimizing-the-notification-system/" target="_blank">blog post</a> by Midtrans.</p>

    <p>This tool was built to help monitoring energy consumption across multiple properties & locations (eg: universities, chain of restaurants etc.)</p>

    <p>We worked remotely with the a team of Engineers at PulseEnergy, for over 2 years. Most of the product was written by us.</p>

    <p>The video below, show some features of the app, allowing slicing & dicing of multiple types of data, across multiple dimensions.</p>

    <p>ABOF, wanted a head start in their front-end dev stack. In a staged manner, we rewrote a few important pages (Landing and product listing page) for performance. Replicated existing functionality with React and server side rendering.</p>

    <p>When we shipped it, it was among the fastest loading sites.</p>

    <p>After the first implementation, the business saw a considerable increase in the conversion rate. They asked us to redo their checkout process as well, which we delivered in time.</p>

    <p>Below is a comparison of loading times of the listing pages of various e-commerce sites, when we delivered ABOF’s listing page.</p>

    <p>We rewrote their core system and setup their infrastructure for reliably handling the growth in traffic. The system also handled adding new product & partner specific workflows.</p>

    <p>Apart from code contributions, we helped provide high level technical guidance & gave regular feedback with code reviews. Some specific tasks we were involved with included introducing webpack to an alpha version of Angular2 when it wasn’t officially supported, de-tangling a micro-services setup, experimenting with GraphQL for some components.</p>
