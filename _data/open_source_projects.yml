     <p>Mini-Mocha is a small experiment at understanding <abbr>DSL</abbr> of <a href="http://mochajs.org/">mochajs.org</a>. About 100 lines of code is enough, to implement the synchronous <abbr>DSL</abbr> that mocha supports. Supporting asynchronous <abbr>DSL</abbr> isn’t much tougher. If you do hack it, please look at our <a href="/careers.html">careers</a> page.</p>

    <p>Devmirror is an experiment at remote debugging. May be, an experiment gone wild. The idea is to render a remote user’s browser screen, to a developer. With devtools open at developers end, which is connected to the users browser session.</p>

    <p>In other words, developer see user’s interaction. And can change the page live, for the user. It’s like local development, but actual browser session is probably happening on the other side of the world.</p>
